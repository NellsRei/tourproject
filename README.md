# VoyageOn  - My first tour booking system

I build this system to better understand typescript.

## A sytem that allows users to book tours and hotels

**Using basic HTML, CSS and TS**

## Dependecies
Ensure you have installed typescript either in your project or globally which you can see how in the documentation `(https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-tooling-in-5-minutes.html)`

## Where to start:

1. Create a dist and src folder
2. On your terminal, run tsc --init and tsc -w commands
